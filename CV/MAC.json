The portfolio consists of a full version control stack called Plastic SCM, a semantic merge tool called Semantic Merge and a Git client with semantic functionality called gmaster. \n\nAs a senior PM my mission was twofold: increasing product activation and reducing churn in SaaS tier. To meet the first goal, product education was fundamental. An on boarding email drip with the key first steps linked to video material explaining the same basic functionality in more detail was setup. Product instrumentation was prioritized to increase the the amount of product usage data focused on interaction, copy and performance. A free one-hour personalized on boarding session with product experts was implemented to complement and extend the first steps automated communication.\n\nAs for churn, feedback loops were shortened by setting up more frequent, shorter surveys to new and mature users. Feedback from one to ones with clients and prospects was added to the information retrieval process, nurturing and modifying the roadmap to a more integrated, more consistent, more intuitive product. In consequence, integration to tools such as IntelliJ, Qt, Jenkins X, Unreal Engine or Unity was prioritized and had resources dedicated to them. .NET framework + Mono for cross platform porting (see case study in Mono’s blog below) was deprecated in benefit of .NET Core which offered better consistency across platforms. Tooltips, self descriptive copy, guides matching Git concepts to Plastic commands and many more text-based help was implemented throughout the product to increase time spent on the GUIs.\n\nAwarness was fundamental too to product adoption. Check all the links below that consist of interviews, product show cases or even webinars I organized, managed and delivered. "
